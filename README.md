ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

After 7 years of professional work in the Belarusian BMX industry, I decided to try myself in new directions and, in particular, improve myself in data analytics and programming.

I don't know how this experiment will end, but it looks very interesting ðŸ˜œ

At the moment I am learning Python for Data Analysis, SQL and tools for BI-analytics.
